## Android Studio Project

My first android app with Android Studio. As always my Hello world equivalent is a price checker!
Trying out Android Studio for the first time but dropped this due to its size. However, just wanted to archive this here in case I need it again.

Very simple to use: Compare the two prices by typing the price and the amount in kilogram, gram, litre etc. and let my app compare it.
However the "Saves you" information might be still a bit misleading as it compares in relative to its given amount. 
The rest should work!
